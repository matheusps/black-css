    <h1>Fostering focus for small screens</h1>
    <h2>How we redesigned Dropbox mobile for rapid work</h2>
    <article>
      <section>
        <p>
          Think about what it’s like to do work on your phone. Your attention is
          fragmented. Your chubby thumbs keep hitting the wrong letters. Often
          times, you just want to get back to real life, whether that’s sitting
          down to dinner with your partner or picking up a conversation with
          your gregarious lunch buddy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you start with that vision, the solutions you come up with for
          mobile work become rather unique. You’re no longer designing to extend
          engagement or keep customers in the app. Rather, you’re helping people
          get in and out and done. You’re zoning in on the problem of focus and
          empowering customers to get the most out of that little moment on a
          small screen. You’re designing for rapid work.

          Over the past year, we’ve revisited our mobile experiences with rapid
          work in mind. Here are a few things that we’ve done to make our
          customers more productive AND more present for their gregarious lunch
          buddies. We hope it’s a help and an encouragement for others who might
          be looking to do the same.

        <h3>Find familiarity between platforms</h3>
        <p>
          A decade ago, Dropbox took advantage of converging patterns on desktop
          operating systems. By leveraging the commonality of desktop file
          browsers, Dropbox was able to present the same “magic folder”
          experience on Macs and PCs.
        </p>
        <p>
          With our recent mobile redesign, we’ve taken advantage of a similar
          convergence that’s happening on iOS and Android. By utilizing patterns
          shared by both operating systems, we’ve created an experience that
          feels familiar on both platforms. Customers can switch phones and hit
          the ground running without having to learn a new UI. Teams can use
          different operating systems without troubleshooting divergent
          interfaces. Fostering familiarity enables fostering focus.
        </p>

          Seven months ago we released a new set of file icons designed to
          improve readability and focus when retrieving files. We asked
          ourselves questions like, “What makes an icon recognizable? How are
          icon types differentiated? How can we distill shapes and forms so that
          customer’s eyes don’t have to work so hard?” Guided by the same
          questions, we’ve updated all the icons in the mobile app to reduce
          complexity and increase readability. Small details like these add up
          to improving focus when completing quick tasks in the app.
